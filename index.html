        <p>Currently I am working on:
(Numbers in the front reflect priority)
1-Own player go into den, that player shouldn't trigger winning message----DONE
if own player is in den, lower rank opponent player won ----- BUG---decided to not let its own player go into the den</p>

<p>4-only rat can swim in river ----possibleMoves() --Add class possible:true to tiles, remove them after moving</p>

<p>2-current player can move his own piece, but not the opponent's ----DONE</p>

<p>3-Player can only fight with opponent piece but not his own ------DONE
(if this.player === )
3.5-remove ranks in traps and rivers ------DONE</p>

<p>5-tiger(6) and lion(7) cannot swim in river but can hop over the river. -----possibleMoves()--Add class possible:true to tiles, remove them after moving</p>

<p>6-The player may capture any enemy piece in one of the player's trap squares regardless of rank. ----var rankBeforeTrap</p>

<p>7-If you click once, and click again on the same piece, it should not let the player move to the same square</p>
